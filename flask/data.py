In 1989, the existing 60,000-seat stadium was demolished and rebuilt with a seating capacity of 10,000 and a beautiful nine-lane track. Surrounded by houses, small businesses and restaurants, and situated adjacent to Golden Gate park, the track feels scenic and historic; doing dynamics on the apron, I’ve often found myself gazing up at the vintage scoreboard with awe, impressed by the way the trees and Victorian houses frame it. There’s a sense of power in the structure, which I’ve channeled in many a meet and workout, and there’s a strong feeling of community in the joggers with headphones sporting Giants shirts, groups doing 800m intervals in OV exercise dresses, and high school teams getting in their own workouts. It feels uniquely San Francisco, both in its setting and in the tie-dye-covered athletes who frequent it, and each time I visit I feel grateful for the opportunity to run in Kezar’s historic lanes as opposed to any old suburban track or a less vibrant facility in any other city."},{"name":"Lovers' Lane","address":"Lover's Ln, San Francisco, CA 94129","description":"Lovers’ Lane has long been a source of pain for me, as it symbolizes the beginning of an arduous upwards trek back home at the end of my runs. It’s also been the site for many a hill workout or speed development interval, and I’ve enjoyed surging up its narrow paved track, passing by the strange memorial of stuffed animals, troll dolls, and homemade crafted tree ornaments that sprung up during the pandemic and dodging runners and strollers on the way. I gave little thought to the history of the trail, although I’d of course heard an old wives tale or two about the source of its nomenclature. It turns out that Lovers’ Lane is one of the oldest foot trails in the Presidio and was originally used by U.S. soldiers to walk to take the trolley line into town in order to visit their families and their sweethearts—their “lovers”—at the end of the 19th century."},{"name":"Marina Green","address":"Marina Green, San Francisco, CA 94123","description":"A hotspot for leisure runners and competitive runners alike, Marina Green and the sandy stretches of trail along Crissy Field that it connects to has adapted from its original role in early aviation history. Leading up to the 1915 Pan Pacific Exposition, this area on the San Francisco waterfront was selected as a spot to promote the new art of aviation and demonstrate the daredevil flying of pilots such as Lincoln Beachey, the first American to perform a loop-the-loop. Nowadays, that same spot serves as the starting point for runners to take off in their own way, completing their own aerodynamic feats in time trials and workouts to match the demonstrations of aeronautic skill that once took place in the sky above them. I will never forget doing windy Crissy Field fartleks, timing our acceleration periods based on iconic Crissy Field landmarks and trying to catch up with other athletes as countless other running clubs used the same location to train."},{"name":"Hopper's Hands","address":"Long Ave & Marine Dr, 201 Marine Dr, San Francisco, CA 94129","description":"During countless runs and “fartlek” workouts, I’ve participated in the ritual of matching my palms to Hopper’s Hands and watched as dozens of people—runners, walkers, bicyclists, and GoCar tourists—took part in the ritual of matching their own palms to Hopper’s Hands. This tradition was taught to me by cross country upperclassmen who had seen others do it before them, and it felt sacred to see this community of people engaging in the same act: all placing their hands in the same spot, giving an indirect high-ten to everyone that came before them and to Ken Hopper, the former ironworker who conceived of the sign. It’s unclear how the tradition started, but runners who took the scenic out-and-back route to Fort Point would always touch the fence barring access to the bottom of the Golden Gate bridge before turning around. Ken Hopper, an ironworker on the Golden Gate Bridge who worked on the bridge’s fences, noticed this strange ritual and conceived of the idea to place a sign there; the sign underwent several different iterations in different color schemes and materials until finally the one that’s up today was created from the same very durable plastic used to make cutting boards. It’s also accompanied by a smaller sign toward the bottom of the fence with paws for people who may want their dogs to participate in the canine version of the tradition."},{"name":"Paul Goode Field","address":"768 Portola St, San Francisco, CA 94129","description":"Another pivotal running spot in the city is Paul Goode Field; although it has only a small stretch of track, it’s provided a meeting spot for myriad practices, and has been the perfect starting point for exploring many of the Presidio’s trails. I feel lucky every time I practice on the only high school playing field in the city with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Paul Goode’s synthetic turf surface and manmade-looking buildings contrast with the lush greenery of the Presidio that surrounds it. Since the trees and forested area are manmade and unnatural in their own ways, however, the relatively new renovation of the field six years ago doesn’t stand out from its surroundings and instead complements them. Just as the U.S. military planted crowds of trees at random over the dunes in the Presidio in the 1880s in order to “accentuate the idea of the power of the Government,” UHS planted scores of synthetic grass in order to symbolize its power as a learning institution."}]

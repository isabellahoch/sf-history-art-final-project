        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>I couldn’t think of a better way to begin my goodbye to San Francisco than through the lens of running. The city is ranked #7 in the U.S. for running because of its competitive racing culture, gorgeous trails, and of course its fantastic hill workout offerings. While I hated running in elementary school and middle school, and despised suicides with a passion, during my time at UHS I’ve learned to love it, and the city has played a huge role in this change. I started off as a sprinter, in disbelief at how the distance runners would run for an hour without stopping, but I eventually worked my way up to mid-distance and doing 90 minute long runs in cross country. I fell in love with distance running because unlike the short bursts of speed in sprint workouts, which I still enjoy now and then, much of my aerobic training comes from runs at an easy pace where I can explore new trails and take in the beauty around me. This project and reflection are equal parts a love letter to running as they are to San Francisco for the two are intertwined for me; now, I can’t think of running without picturing the Presidio’s trails, and, likewise, I can’t imagine exploring new corners of the city anywhere but on foot. I chose to compile a collection of sites related to my personal running journey in the city, my experience as a part of the UHS track and cross country teams, and the broader SF running community.<br>While of course I must acknowledge the terrible and continuing repercussions of the pandemic, COVID did carve out quite a bit of time in my schedule, and in the early days I took advantage of this flexibility to explore the city and test my running abilities. After one week of quarantine, I set out on an easy run and, motivated by the empty trails and beautiful view of the Bay, just kept running, and completed my first-ever half marathon. Since then, I’ve run five half marathons in different loops around the city—stopping by Land’s End, Fisherman’s Wharf, Stow Lake, and many other scenic sites on the way. I embedded these routes, and some of my other memorable San Francisco running experiences, both on my website and in my map both to inspire other runners to take on the same routes and as a way for me to recall those meaningful runs and honor them in a way other than the training log output from my watch.
